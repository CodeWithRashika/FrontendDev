    <p>I have become more guarded towards people and sometimes I am sad about that. It’s because I’ve been hurt a couple of times by people. They told me they were my friend but actually they didn’t really care for me. Some used me as a stepping stone, some dropped me when something better came along.

        But I also learned what kind of people I can trust. True friends are forgiving. They will understand when you explain how you feel. They will be there for you when you need them, and you will unconditionally have their backs too.
        My best friends are the ones I can not speak to for six months and still everything is the way it’s always been, it’s the people that understand my job is my life, the ones I can be myself with without pretending I’m someone I’m not. And that’s the people you need. To me, a true friendship is real success.</p>
